You are a data scientist working at a financial institute (e.g. bank). Your company lends money 
to users in the form of cash loans. You are tasked to eventually build a machine learning model 
that can predict whether a user will default on their loan at the point of loan application. For this 
assignment, you will be preparing the data through production data pipelines in preparation for 
machine learning model training.Explore the data provided and design feature store table(s) that is compatible with a 
classification machine learning model. You are only required to build the data pipeline for the 
feature store table(s) from raw data up to gold table(s).Your eventual feature store and label store will be gold level table or tables (depending on your 
design choice). Ensure that all pipelines and jobs are compliant with Medallion Architecture
